Before Cloud,
To launch an application
Stage 1: Need server, storage, network......
after some days having nother copy of in another server
	Stage 2: Data Center ->  server, another server(redundant), storage, network.....
after some days,copy of data center but needs to do disaster recovery
	Disaster recovery -> if something happens to one data center , we should have another data center 
virtualisation:
With in a physical machine, we can create n no of virtual servers and we can launch n no of applications but it depends on physical machine capacity
We cannot have numerous virtual servers .there is some limitations

many companies using virtualisation but very few are using cloud


Challenges:
	Storage will be left idle if we are not using but we are paying for the idle memory
	man power is more - for each and every team there shuld be a support
	ex: storage, network, securty, developer,monitoring....

Cloud service:
	Services and solutions that are deliverd and consumed in real time over internet are cloud services
Cloud computing:
	Delivery model of computing servives
